# Changelog

## 2026-03-30

### Features

- **Guest session ID for temporary holds** — `resolveGuestSessionId.js` utility generates a unique per-tab guest ID (`12345` + 7 random digits) stored in `sessionStorage`. Used as `userId`/`fanId` fallback when fan is not logged in, replacing the shared static `userId = 1`.

### Bug Fixes

- **`BookingFlowStep3` — guest fan hold** — `ensureTemporaryHold` now passes `resolveFanId() || resolveGuestSessionId()` as `userId`/`fanId` in the flow context, preventing "Missing required fields: userId" for unauthenticated fans.

- **`BookingFlowStep3` — temporary hold userId mismatch** — `finalizeBooking` now calls `bookings.updateTemporaryHoldUser` before `createBooking` on all payment paths (topup and direct), replacing the guest placeholder userId with the real authenticated userId.

- **`createBookingMapper` — fanId `??` vs `||`** — changed nullish coalescing to `||` so a falsy `fanId = 0` correctly falls through to the context fallback instead of being used as-is.

- **`TopUpForm` — hardcoded `userId` and `creatorId`** — replaced `localStorage.getItem('userId') ?? 0` and hardcoded `creatorId = 1` with props received from `BookingFlowStep3`. `resolveFanUserId()` now returns `props.fanId || window.userData.userID || 0`; `resolveCreatorId()` returns `props.creatorId || 0`. Guest session ID is intentionally not forwarded to the payment form.

### New Files

- `src/utils/resolveGuestSessionId.js` — guest session ID generator

### New Flow Registrations (`flowRegistry.js`)

- `bookings.updateTemporaryHoldUser`

### New Flows

- `src/services/bookings/flows/updateTemporaryHoldUserFlow.js` — `PATCH /temporary-holds/:id/user`

## 2026-03-26

### Features
- **Message status indicators** — outgoing messages now show inline status icons inside the bubble:
  - Clock (gray) = `pending` (optimistic, before API responds)
  - Single checkmark (gray) = `sent` (API confirmed)
  - Double checkmark (gray) = `delivered` (recipient's socket received it)
  - Double checkmark (blue) = `read` (recipient viewed it)

- **Visibility-based read receipts** — uses `IntersectionObserver` (root = chat scroll container, threshold 0.5) instead of a blanket on-mount scan. Messages are marked as read only when they scroll into the visible area of the chat window. Works for both new incoming messages and historical messages scrolled into view.

- **Last message sync in chat list** — `ChatListPanel` now updates in real time:
  - Updates when a message arrives via socket
  - Updates when the current user sends a message
  - Format: `"You: text"` for own messages, `"Name: text"` for others (name resolved from `chatUsersData`)

- **Unread indicator from API on page load** — on mount, `ChatFloatingWidget` calls `GET /chats/:chatId/unread?userId=...` in parallel for all chats and sets the exact server count. Previously the count was lost on every reload.

- **Unread dot reactive updates** — dot appears when a message arrives via socket; clears when the user views the messages (IntersectionObserver fires).

### Bug Fixes
- **`api.get` query params silently dropped** — `api.get(url, obj)` spreads the second arg into `request()` options; only a key named `params` reaches `constructUrl` and gets appended to the URL. All affected flows were passing query params directly and they were being ignored. Fixed in:
  - `fetchMessagesFlow.js` — `limit` and `pagingState` were never sent; pagination was broken
  - `getUnreadCountFlow.js` — `userId` was never sent
  - `searchMessagesFlow.js`
  - `getChatParticipantsFlow.js`
  - `fetchMessagesByUserFlow.js`
  - `searchGroupsFlow.js`

- **`watch(messages)` not firing on socket push** — shallow watch does not detect array mutations (`.push`). Replaced with `watch(() => messages.value.length)` + `IntersectionObserver`.

- **Unread count lost on page reload** — `fetchUserChats` response `unread_count` was stale. Now re-fetched via dedicated unread endpoint on every mount.

### Refactoring
- **`sendSocket(flag, payload)` primitive** in `useChatSocket.js` — extracted common socket send logic. `sendChatMessage` and `sendStatusUpdate` both delegate to it instead of duplicating mode-switching code.

### New Flow Registrations (`flowRegistry.js`)
- `chat.markMessageDelivered`
- `chat.markMessageRead`
- `chat.getUnreadCount`

### Store Actions Added (`useChatStore.js`)
- `updateMessageStatusAction({ chatId, messageId, status })` — patches only the `status` field on a message
- `updateChatLastMessage(chatId, message)` — replaces `last_message` on a chat row
- `updateChatUnread(chatId, hasUnread)` — toggles unread indicator (increments / resets to 0)
- `setChatUnreadCount(chatId, count)` — sets exact count from API

### UI Changes
- `ChatListPanel` height set to `h-[480px]` to match chat window height
- `ChatListPanel` `z-[9999]` added
- `FlexChat` exposes `bodyEl` ref via `defineExpose` for use as `IntersectionObserver` root

## 2026-03-26 (Session 2)

### Features
- **Post-booking chat creation** — after a booking is confirmed in `BookingFlowStep3.vue`, a direct chat is automatically created between fan and creator under the following conditions:
  - `allowInstantBooking=true AND allowPersonalRequestRequired=true` → chat created
  - `allowInstantBooking=false` → chat created
  - Otherwise → no chat created
- **Booking request message** — after chat creation, a `booking_request` message (action: `pending`) is sent and pinned in the new chat
- **`slot_date` resolved from preflight payload** — reads `fanBooking.booking.lastPreflightPayload.startIso` (was incorrectly trying two state keys that are never set)
- **Chat list reloads without page refresh** — after `sendBookingRequestMessage` succeeds, the booking flow sends a `chat:message` socket event to all participants; each user's `_handleIncomingChatMessage` detects the unknown `chat_id` and calls `chat.fetchUserChats` before processing the message

### Bug Fixes
- **`createChat` missing required fields** — payload was missing `createdBy` and participants were not strings. Fixed: added `createdBy: String(fanUserId)`, converted `participants` to `[String(fanUserId), String(creatorId)]`
- **`chat.markMessageRead` called for already-read messages** — `observeNewRows()` was observing all rows including those with `status='read'`. Fixed by skipping messages where `msg?.status === 'read'`

### Changes (`useChatSocket.js`)
- `_handleIncomingChatMessage` is now `async` — awaits `chat.fetchUserChats` when an incoming message belongs to an unknown chat, ensuring the chat row exists in the store before `addMessage` and `updateChatLastMessage` run

### Changes (`BookingFlowStep3.vue`)
- `createChat` payload now includes `name` (event title) and `description` (`"Booking request for <eventTitle>"`)
- Imports `useChatSocket` to send `chat:message` socket event to participants after booking request message is created

### New Flow Registrations (`flowRegistry.js`)
- `chat.sendBookingRequestMessage`
- `chat.pinMessage`
